        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Create a game like Hearthstone, programmed in the language C++!</p>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>
            The game is played by 2 player. Each having 7 handcards and 7 play fields. The aim is to 
            attack the enemy with the playcards until he is dead (30 Life Points). You can place your
            handcards into the field, when you have enough mana. The cards are categorisized in Spell-Cards
            and Creature-Cards. Spell Cards can not be put on the gamefield, but can be cast. Furthermore
            each player has a graveyard, where all the killed Creature-Cards are placed. You can also
            sacrifice a Card, what means, you place the card on the graveyard, and gain 1LP<br>
            It's a roundbased system, where the players get for each round a certain amount of mana. <br>
            The first one to kill the enemy wins.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <p>
            The game needs a config file, which has the .json format and is parsed via the rapidjson istreamwrapper.
            Each Creature-Card needs these following attributes:<br>  
            - name [Name of the Creature-Card]<br>  
            - mana_cost [The mana what is needed to place the Card]<br>  
            - damage_points [How much damage the card does, when attacking]<br>  
            - life_points [How many Life points the Card has]<br>  
            - shield [If a card is placed in the field and has the shield attribute, the player cannot be attacked]<br>  
            Each Spell-Card needs to have the following attribute:<br>
            - name [The name of the Spell-Card]<br>
        </p>
        <h3>User Input</h3>
        <p>
            For displaying the commands: <code>help</code><br>
            For attacking: <code>attack #x #y</code><br>
            For placing a Creature-Card: <code>set #x to #y</code><br>
            For casting a Spell-Card: <code>cast #x</code><br>
            For sacrificing a Card: <code>sacrifice #x</code><br>
            For displaying the gamefield: <code>state</code><br>
            For ending your turn: <code>finish</code><br>
            For quitting the game: <code>quit</code><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Config-File Creature-Card</h3>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_configFile.png" alt="hearthstone_configFile" style="width: auto;"><br>
            This is only one Creature-Card, you can add as much as you want.
        <h3>Config-File Spell-Card</h3>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_configFile2.png" alt="hearthstone_configFile2" style="width: auto;"><br>
            This is only one Spell Card, you can add some more, but the names of the spell cards are hardcoded.
            For now, there exist: <br>
            - Rebirth [Revives the card, who is on top of the graveyard]<br>
            - Healer [Heals all Creature-Cards for 1LP (Max LP Points are 9)]<br>
            - Relief [The player has to pick up 3 Cards]<br>
            - Dracula [Attacks the enemy player by 2LP and heals you for 2LP]<br>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p> 
                The whole game was developed in VSC (Visual Studio Code). It's a console game, which
                can be played in every UNIX-Console.
            </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The whole purpose of the program was, to pass a subject for my Degree in Computer Science.
                the subject was named "Object Oriented Programming 1". The main Goal of the Subject was, to
                teach the fundamentals of the programming language C++. 
            </p>
        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>I learned the fundamentals of the programming language C++. Inlcuding the usage of classes and 
            objects. We also used derived classes, for our 2 different Card Types.
        </p>
        <h3>Error handling</h3>
            <p>
                Also a big part of the project was, to handle wrong inputs and not allowing to make 
                not valid moves. Speficic error messages were included, to inform the player that i 
                made a mistake. Since the university had a lot of testcases (In specific 98 for error
                handling), I'm sure the game is bulletproof to almost every user input.
            </p>

        <h3>Example Game</h3>
        <p>Player have to input their names, then the game starts</p>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_0.png" alt="hearthstone_0" >
        <p>Since Jim has only 1 Mana, i has to finish his round with the <code>finish</code> command.</p>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_1.png" alt="hearthstone_1" >
        <p>Exactly the same for Taylor <code>finish</code>. </p>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_2.png" alt="hearthstone_2" >
        <p>Jim now got some mana and can place the Creature_Card number 4 (Simone) on the gamefield
            <code>set 4 to 1</code>. But since the card was placed this round, she sleeps. Meaning that
            Jim has to wait another round to attack. To see the move he made, he can execute the 
        <code>state</code> command.</p>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_3.png" alt="hearthstone_3" >
        <p> Taylor follows another strategie, he saves his mana to place a stronger figure next round. So he executes
            the <code>finish</code> command. Jim now attacks the enemy player with his Creature-Card Simone. The attack
            damages the enemy player by 1LP. He executes the <code>attack 0 with 1</code> command. Since he already attacked,
            the == signe is displayed in the middle of the card, which means, that he can not attack another time.
        </p>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_4.png" alt="hearthstone_4" >
        <p>Since the game goes around 10-20minutes, I will not show the whole game. So lets say Taylor surrends with the 
            <code>quit</code> command.
        </p>
            <img src="pics/hearthstone_5.png" alt="hearthstone_5" >
        <p>Since Taylor surrended, Jim won!</p>
