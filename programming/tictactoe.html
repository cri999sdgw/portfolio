    <div class="fieldLeft">
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Make a playable version of the Game Tic-Tac-Toe, programmed in the language python!</p>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>
            Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces 
            in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
            or diagonal row is the winner.
        </p>
        <h3>User Input</h3>
        <p>
            Valid inputs are integer numbers between 1 and 9 (One number for each playable field).
        </p>
        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>No external libraries, but the visualisation has to be made with the turtle API</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The whole purpose of the program was, to pass a subject for my Degree in Computer Science.
        the subject was named "Programming 0". The main Goal of the Subject was, to
        teach the fundamentals of programming with the language Python. 
        </p>
        <h3>Stats</h3>
        <p>To make the program work, i used: <br> - 509 lines of code <br> - 15 functions</p>
        <h3>visualisation</h3>
        <p>The Game should not only be playable in the terminal, but also have a visual UI. For
            the visualisation i had to use the Turtle library. The library uses a cursor which can 
            go straight forward and turn in specific degrees. Everything visual was drawen by the cursor. <br>
            The player can also chose between different colors, which is prompted at the beginning of the game.
        </p>
        <h3>Setup for new Game</h3>
        <p>The setup is quiet easy, first you can chose two different colors</p>
            <img src="pics/tictactoe_setup.png" alt="tictactoe_setup" style="width:35vw;">
        <p>After you inserted 2 colors, it will repeat them, before setting up the playfield and start the game.</p>

        <h3>Example Execution</h3>
        <p>Gamefield</p>
            <img src="pics/tictactoe_1.png" alt="tictactoe_1" style="width:30vw;">
        <p>Let's place our 'X' on field 1 by typing <code>1</code> in the terminal.</p>
            <img src="pics/tictactoe_2.png" alt="tictactoe_2" style="width:30vw;">
        <p>Now it's the other players turn. Place the 'O' to field 2 by typing <code>2</code> in the terminal.</p>
            <img src="pics/tictactoe_3.png" alt="tictactoe_3" style="width:30vw;">
        <p>To speed things up, lets show the winning screen with the input: <code>3</code> <code>5</code> <code>4</code> <code>8</code>.</p>
            <img src="pics/tictactoe_4.png" alt="tictactoe_4" style="width:30vw;">
        <p>In the terminal following output was generated.</p>
