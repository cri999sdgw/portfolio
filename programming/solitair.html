        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Make a playable Solitair Game, programmed in the language C!</p>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>
            The objective of the game is to release and play into position certain cards 
            to build up each foundation, in sequence and in suit, from the ace through the king. 
            The ultimate objective is to build the whole pack onto the foundations, and if that 
            can be done, the Solitaire game is won.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <p>
            The game is played with 52 Cards which are initialized trough a config file. The Program
            then picks the given order and sets up the game field. The Game can now be played!
        </p>
        <h3>User Input</h3>
        <p>
            For displaying the commands: <code>help</code><br>
            For moving a card: <code>move #color #value to #stacknumber</code><br>
            For exit the game: <code>exit</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Example Config File</h3>
            <img src="pics/solitair_configFile.png" alt="solitair_configFile" style="height:600px;">
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>Since this is a console game and no other visualization is implemented, the IDE was
            not that important. I chose Visual Studio Code (vsc), since it is my main text editor.<br>
            I programmed on MacOS and used the terminal for compiling and executing the program. Since
            the reference OS of the University (Technical University of Graz) was Linux, i used an external
            linux Server to test the game. I reached it with an ssh connection via the macOS terminal. <br>

        </p>
        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>The usage of external libraries was prohibited (expect the standard libraries). To make it run, 
            I used three different libraries: <br> - stdio.h <br> - string.h <br> - stdlib.h <br>
            Memory management is very important, when you program in C, so i had to allocate, reallocate and
            free the space i needed. For checking if everything worked correct, I used Valgrind at the external
            Linux System.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The whole purpose of the program was, to pass a subject for my Degree in Computer Science.
        the subject was named "Programming 1", where I made other small projects like Hangman or the
        Caesar Encryption, which are also shown on the website. The main Goal of the Subject was, to
        teach the fundamentals of the programming language C. 
        </p>
        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>I learned the fundamentals of the programming language C and the importance of efficient
            memory management. I learned how to use References and Pointers. Structs, enums and several
            other data structures where implemented to make the game playable. 
        </p>
        <h3>Stats</h3>
        <p>To make the program work, i used: <br> - 1552 lines of code <br> - 34 functions <br> - 4 enums <br> - 1 struct</p>
        <h3>Error handling</h3>
        <p>If the user makes a wrong input, the program can react to it like in the followed example</p>

        <p>Gamefield</p>
            <img src="pics/solitair_1.png" alt="solitair_1" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>Commands can now be entered. For example we execute the <code>help</code> command which
        leads to following screen</p>
            <img src="pics/solitair_2.png" alt="solitair_2" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>For moving a card, we can use the <code>move</code> command. We can move
        the Red-7 from stack number 3 to stack number 4. We execute it with <code>move red 7 to 4</code> </p>
            <img src="pics/solitair_3.png" alt="solitair_3" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>Since the Black Ace on stack number 1 can be placed on a new stack, we can move it to
            stack number 5 (Dep) with the command <code>move move black A to 5</code> </p>
            <img src="pics/solitair_4.png" alt="solitair_4" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>On the left, we can get a new card, by placing the Black 6 on stack number 0 to the stack 4.
            Following command is needed <code> move Black 6 to 4</code></p>
            <img src="pics/solitair_5.png" alt="solitair_5" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>To exit the game, just type <code>exit</code> and the program stops</p>
