        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Encrypt a given text with the Caesar Encryption, programmed in the language C!</p>
        <h3>Program Description</h3>
        <p>
            Method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number 
            of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it 
            in his private correspondence. The key by which the characters get shifted is calculated
            via 256 mod #InputCharLength.
        </p>
        <h3>User Input</h3>
        <p>
            The user has to do input the text to encode.
        </p>
        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>The usage of external libraries was prohibited (expect the standard libraries). To make it run, 
            I used three different libraries: <br> - stdio.h <br> - stdlib.h</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The whole purpose of the program was, to pass a subject for my Degree in Computer Science.
        the subject was named "Programming 1", where I made other small projects like Hangman or the
        the game Solitair, which are also shown on the website. The main Goal of the Subject was, to
        teach the fundamentals of the programming language C. 
        </p>
        <h3>Stats</h3>
        <p>To make the program work, i used: <br> - 140 lines of code <br> - 4 functions <br> - 1 enum </p>

        <h3>Example Execution</h3>
        <p>Input prompt</p>
            <img src="pics/encrypt_1.png" alt="encrypt_1" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>The user gets prompted to input the text to encrypt.</p>
            <img src="pics/encrypt_2.png" alt="encrypt_2" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>The user input was <code>abc</code> meaning that the key is 256 mod 3.
        What is equal to 1, meaning that each character needs to be shifted by 1.
        Ending up to <code>bcd</code></p>
        <h3>Another example Execution</h3>
        <p>Input prompt</p>
            <img src="pics/encrypt_1.png" alt="encrypt_1" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>The user gets prompted to input the text to encrypt. Now we chose also
            whitespaces and a longer text.</p>
            <img src="pics/encrypt_3.png" alt="encrypt_3" style="width:25vw;">
        <p>The user input was <code>text to encrypt</code> meaning that the key is 256 mod 13.
            What is equal to 9, meaning that each character needs to be shifted by 9. If the alphabet
            has reached the end, it starts all over again. The whitespaces stay the same and are ignored
            for the length of the input. So this encryption ends up to <code>cngc cx nwlahyc</code></p>
