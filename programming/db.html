        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Ingest a Database with a given set of data. The programming language can be chosen.
        </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Given is a lot of data describing publications of theses and journals. Who wrote them, in which
            year they were made public and much more is also included. The Database is a MySQL Database and
            is visualized with the postgres UI Tool. Create a relational schema and ingest the data.
        </p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>
            Since we had a lot of data to ingest, the timing should not exceed more then 3 minutes. The
            ingest time of the reference system was 21s, which i toped. My ingestion time was 15s using python.
        </p>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>The IDE i chose was Visual Studio Code (vsc), since it is my main text editor.<br>
            I programmed on MacOS and used the terminal for compiling and executing the program. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Restrictions</h3>
        <p>The usage of external libraries was prohibited (expect psycopg2). The whole ingestion
            needed to execute SQL commands.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The whole purpose of the program was, to pass a subject for my Degree in Computer Science.
        the subject was named "Datamangement". The main Goal of the Subject was, to teach the fundamentals 
        of Datamangement. 
        </p>
        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>I learned the fundamentals of Datamangement. How a Database works, what relational schemas are,
            how SQL works and much more.
        </p>
        <h3>Stats</h3>
        <p>To make the program work, i used: <br> - 524 lines of code.

        <h3>Example Ingestion</h3>

        <p>The whole log of ingestion was printed in the terminal to make it readable and
            to take track trough the execution.</p>
        <h3>The corresponding relational schema</h3>
